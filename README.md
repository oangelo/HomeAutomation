# Home Automation

This is a simple home automation project I am making for my home.
My intent is to build a simple circuit for: 
* turn on/off the lights of two lampshades, 
* to record the room temperature and humidity, 
* to detect presence using some PIRs 
* and to measure the ambient light with a LDR.
All this controlled wirelessly.

I have theses components for this task:
* Arduino Nano -> Brain
* esp2866 (esp-01) -> Wireless
* DHT-22 -> Temperature and humidity. 
* LDR -> Ambient Light intensity 
* PIR -> Movement detection
* RELAY -> To turn lamps on/off
* AC to DC converter -> To power the circuit
* Some resistors.
